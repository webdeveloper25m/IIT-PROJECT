With large volumes of data being generated each day, across various domains, the need for bringing together the field of Data Science and the different domains is higher than ever. The  Interdisciplinary Dual Degree in Data Science (IDDD-DS) programme offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IITM, aims to project the versatility of Data Science. The course gives students from different disciplines, an opportunity to harness the power of Data Science, to supplement their core area of research. Accordingly, RBCDSAIâ€™s Data Science related courses are handled by faculties from various departments. Also, IDDD-DS students actively collaborate with RBCDSAI faculty on various research activities.

The 5 year dual degree program in Data Science is open to B.Tech students of IIT Madras, from any discipline. The students can join in the 6th semester, provided the student meets certain minimum academic norms. Depending on the interests of the student, one can choose to specialize in a specific application area or acquire deeper grounding in the fundamentals of data science.
