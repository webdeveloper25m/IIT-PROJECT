The summer school programs are a perfect platform for the talented group of students to
gain in-depth knowledge of advanced techniques. RBCDSAI conducted summer school on “Data
Sciences” for a week as a part of ACM India summer school. The summer school offered great
exposure on the mathematical foundation of statistics and machine learning (ML) and advanced
ML methods to the selected self-motivated students. Renowned faculties from different IITs
headed this short course. For more information on the summer school, please visit
