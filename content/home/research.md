Undoubtedly, Artificial intelligence (AI) and Data Science are revolutionizing every aspect of our lives. To provide further strength to this revolution, Robert Bosch Centre of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI) was founded in the year 2017 at IIT Madras with the aim to expand both research and education in the area of artificial intelligence and Data Science. Interdisciplinary in nature, the RBCDSAI hosts researchers who are leveraging AI in their respective domains to usher its true potential. The scientists are working on both basic research and applied research projects to make AI technology more powerful, accurate and safe to use while delivering its real-world applications. The basic research projects currently being undertaken at the centre include safety and stability preserving reinforcement learning, network representation learning, learning with limited and partial data, domain agnostic methods for integration of prior knowledge in learning algorithms. On the applications side, the researchers at the centre are working to expand the scope of AI in areas like smart cities, systems biology and health care, manufacturing analytics and financial analytics.
