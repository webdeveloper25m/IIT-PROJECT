Through various Programs designed for academics at different levels of their careers, the Centre encourages, supports, and recognizes young researchers, post-graduates, faculty and stalwarts with a passion for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. The Distinguished Fellow Program honors academics for their valuable contribution to the field, and foster long-term relationships with them. Through the Associate Research Program, faculty members from academic institutions and colleges have the opportunity to pursue research in the field, which expands and brings in new collaborative opportunities. The Visiting Researcher Program primarily targeted at the international cohort of post-graduates and postdocs and a Research Experience Program to host research scholars from other universities provides support to researchers and helps build and strengthen collaboration through their research work in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Over the years the Centre has built and forged prime collaborative initiatives with prestigious government institutes such as SERB, NCBS, THSTI,DRDO, and also the industry with companies such as Google, Intel, GE, IBM Research and Microsoft Research.
