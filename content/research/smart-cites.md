The centre carries out research in many aspects of Smart Cities. We work closely with the Centre of Excellence in Urban Transportation in developing solutions for smart mobility, traffic modelling and analysis.We work on several aspects of smart power grids from analysing PMU data to looking at learning efficient strategies for next day power markets. Smart water distribution in urban areas is another active area of study
