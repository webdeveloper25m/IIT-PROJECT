I completed my PhD from the Department of Chemical Engineering at IIT Madras. My PhD dealt with Modelling of hydrodynamics, mass transfer and reactions in two-phase flows in a microchannel. My research as a Postdoctoral fellow would deal with the Modelling and control of integrated multi-scale disease network.
