I have completed my B.Tech in CSE from NIT, Rourkela and worked as systems engineer in TCS for 3 years. Currently, I am pursuing my M.Tech degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras. I am working on my masters thesis project "Estimation of inter- and intra-layer edges in a multi-layer Markov network" under Dr. Manikandan Narayanan.
