I am an MS Scholar in the Dept. Of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras, with Prof. B. Ravindran as my guide. I am interested in the fields of NLP and RL. Currently, I am working on using reinforcement learning to solve the language understanding problem via the process of playing text-based games.
