I received Bachelors and Masters of Technology in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in Aug 2009. I completed my PhD in Computer Engineering from ETH Zurich in Jan 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Lothar Thiele. I was a post-doc at ETH Zurich from Jan to Dec 2014. I then spent over 2.5 years at IBM Research, Bangalore and a few months consulting for machine learning startups. I joined IIT Madras as an Assistant Professor in Mar 2018.
