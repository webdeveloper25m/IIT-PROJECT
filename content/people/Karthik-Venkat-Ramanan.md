My broad area of research is representation learning for heterogeneous networks. I'm currently working on knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embeddings. I'm also interested in reinforcement learning and transfer learning for deep networks. I graduated from NIT Trichy with a B.Tech in CSE in 2019.
