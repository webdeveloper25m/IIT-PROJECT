I am working as a Project Associate in RBCDSAI at IIT-Madras under the guidance of Prof. Balaraman Ravindran. I completed my BTech course (2014-2018) in the Dept. of CSE from IIIT-Bhubaneswar where my thesis involved optimization of low-level parameters in Hadoop. My current project is in collaboration with Applied Materials and it involves modeling states in the given time-series data.
