I'm working as a Project Associate under the guidance of Prof. Mitesh M Kapra. Prior to that, I graduated from IIT Madras in 2017 with bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and then worked as a software developer in Amazon for 18 months. I'm interested in Deep learning area and I'm currently working on learning network/graph representations.
