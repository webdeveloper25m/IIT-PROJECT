I am a Project Associate at RBCDSAI, working with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran. My work has focused on network representation learning, clustering and semi-supervised learning with hypergraphs. Previously, I worked on deep end-to-end clustering. I am also exploring the area of interpretable machine learning.
