I am a recent B-Tech graduate from IIIT Sri City (2020). I am currently working Smooth Imitaion learning policies and minerl. I am also working on State-Only Imitaion Learning. I am an avid football fan and I would love to apply the concept of Deep Reinforcement Learning to active football gameplay. I have previously worked on using Deep Reinforcement Learning to achieve autonomy in cars. I have also worked at MBRDI where I created a real time crowd analysing network.
