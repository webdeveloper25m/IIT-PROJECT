I’m a B.Tech Bioinformatics graduate from Sathyabama University. I’m currently working as a Project Associate under Dr. Karthik Raman. I’m involved in designing an in silico computational pipeline that integrates genomic data gathering with analytic tools to detect cancer-associated mutations. I’m an avid reader. You can either find me with an interesting book and a hot chocolate or at a café exploring other foods!
