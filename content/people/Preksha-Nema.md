I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra and co-guided by Dr. Balaraman Ravindran at IIT Madras. I joined IIT Madras as an M.Tech in July 2015, and then converted to Ph.D. programme in March 2017. My area of research is Deep learning for NLP. Currently my work is focussed on modelling better attention mechanism techniques for different Natural Language Generation tasks.
