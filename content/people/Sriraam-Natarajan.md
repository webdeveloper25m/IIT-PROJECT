My research interests lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and their application to healthcare problems. More specifically, I am interested in the areas of Relational Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graphical Models, and Planning.Till 2013, I was a faculty member at Translational Science Institute of Wake Forest School of Medicine. I was a Post-Doc earlier at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Wisconsin Madison, working with Professors Jude Shavlik and David Page. I completed my PhD in fall 2007 under Professor Prasad Tadepalli in the School of EECS at Oregon State University.
