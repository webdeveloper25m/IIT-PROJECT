I am working as a Project Associate in RBCDSAI at IIT-Madras under the guidance of Prof. Balaraman Ravindran. I graduated from Shiv Nadar University in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am very interested in the fields of deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am currently working on deep learning for image registration and reinforcement learning in confounded environments.
