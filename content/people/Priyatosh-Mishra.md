I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Madras. I am working under the supervision of Prof. B. Ravindran in the area of affordance learning. Specifically, I am investigating the use of planning techniques for solving certain problems that arise in affordance learning systems.
