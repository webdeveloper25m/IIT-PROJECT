I am guided by Dr. Balaraman Ravindran and Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra. My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am currently working on incorporating information from unstructured data in Dialogue Systems. I have recently started exploring incorporation of linguistic structures such as dependency graphs to improve performance on NLP tasks.
