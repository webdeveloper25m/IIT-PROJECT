AI technologies have long been used by Web developers and the major platforms to provide increasingly intelligent services for Web and internet users, and it was always part of Tim Berners-Lee’s original design to develop an intelligent, or semantic, Web that enabled machines to infer knowledge from interconnected documents and data. Web Science studies the evolution of the Web from a sociotechnical perspective and how human intelligence interacts with the artificial intelligence we derive from our use of the Web.</p><p align="justify">Artificial Intelligence is set to transform society in the coming decades in ways that have long been predicted by science fiction writers but are only now becoming feasible because of recent developments in computing technology, machine learning and the availability of massive amounts of data on which to train the algorithms. The potential is enormous and governments around the world are worrying about the impact of AI on society both in terms of how it will change the world of work, but also in terms of the potential advantages that the technology can bring to society. But we must also be very aware of the potential threats to society that such developments might bring and the ethical, accountability and diversity issues we need to address, including particularly the world of software automation. If we don’t lay the groundwork well now, there is huge potential for chaos and confusion in the future as AI starts to become more dominant in all our lives, which is why I argue we need to take a socio-technical approach to every aspect of the evolution of AI in society as we have for the study of the Web.</p><p align="justify">But as a result of all these developments we are facing a time of major change and disruption for the internet – the technology that has underpinned so much societal change over the last fifty years. In this talk we will argue that we must take a sociotechnical approach to our analysis of the evolution of the internet in order to ensure that the internet of the future helps us create a world that we all want to live in.</p></details></li></ul>'+

Online social cognition based on the dynamics of social media is increasingly playing a central role in business, politics, governance, and even in shaping our personal lives. There has been a dearth of computational models of social cognition, that has impeded deeper analysis of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a model for online social cognition. A social discourse is defined as the set of all activities, opinions and actors involved in social interaction around a topic. A discourse is modelled as a "marketplace of opinions", where parties invest opinions to get different kinds of returns-- be they sales, or votes or likes. An opinion in turn is modelled as a combination of an abstractive and an expressive component, each of which have different psychological impacts on participants. A notion of compatibility of opinions is then introduced, and clusters of compatible opinions form the different narratives, driving the discourse. We then characterise each narrative by its salient opinions, and identify two classes of participants for each narrative: opinion drivers and narrative drivers. The social discourse itself is then modelled as an interaction graph of narratives. Interactions between narratives are identified as either compatible or conflicting, based on the sentiment in the inter narrative conversations. This then brings us a concept of stability of the discourse, based on the Cartwright-Harary theorem of social networks. A discourse is said to be active as long as it is unstable, and has the potential for different forms of social impact. A stable discourse on the other hand, would have settled down into different camps.</p><p align="justify"><strong>About the speaker:</strong> Srinath Srinivasa heads the Web Science lab and is the Dean (Research and Development) at IIIT Bangalore, India.

The key to study such interactions, in his understanding, is not the individual and his psychology, but “the syntactical relations among the acts of different persons mutually present to one another” (Goffman 1967, Interaction Ritual, pp. 2 as cited in Schegloff 1988 pp. 94). Accordingly, this framework has been applied in the analysis of human-human interactions on online platforms (e.g., Hogan, 2010; Bullingham & Vasconcelos, 2013) and in the analysis of human-machine interactions (e.g., Bucher, 2014; Lee, Frank, Beute, de Kort., & IJsselsteijn, 2017). We extend Goffman dramaturgical framework to analyse the interactions that take place between humans and conversational agents such as Alexa, Google Echo and so on. We see these assistants as performative agents engaging in social interactions with their human counterparts where in the “backstage” of both human and non-human remain inaccessible (Latour 1996). We ask, what are the different types of strategies the voice assistants can employ for "impression management"? How can we analyze these strategies without having access to the "backstage"? How do the conversational agents maintain decorum of expected behavior? With this analytical approach, we aim to understand to what extent sustained “natural” conversations may take place between humans and  conversational agents.</p></details></li></ul>'+

Project Debater is a research technology by IBM that pushes the frontiers of AI to facilitate intelligent debate on complex topics. Going beyond existing research around question-answering and dialog, our goal is to build a natural language system that assists people in building persuasive arguments and evidence-based decisions by mining knowledge from the web and many other sources when there is no clear right or wrong answer. We rely on three pioneering capabilities: data-driven argument construction and delivery, listening comprehension, and the modeling of human dilemmas. This talk will provide a glimpse into some of the advances made in this project and summarize some of the scientific publications that have come out of this research.  <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater/">https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater/</a></p></details></li></ul>'+

Comparatively less has been done about modeling types and their associated relations (is-instance-of and is-subtype-of). In the first part of the talk, I will present a new representation of types as hyper-rectangles rather than points, which are commonly used to embed words and entities. I will propose an elementary loss function representing rectangle containment. I will also demonstrate that recent work on type representation has used a questionable evaluation protocol, and propose a sound alternative. Experiments using type supervision from the WordNet noun hierarchy show the superiority of our approach. In the second part of the talk, I will move to unsupervised discovery of type representation. The idea is to represent each entity using a type and a residual vector. Each relation is represented by two type-checking vectors and an entity-to-entity compatibility checking vector. We do not use any supervision from KG schema to guide the type (checking) embeddings. Experiments on FB15k and YAGO show two benefits. First, inferring new triples becomes more accurate, exceeding state of the art. Second, the type embeddings are very good predictors of KG types to which the entities belong, although this information was not available during training. </p></details></li></ul>'+

They need to employ relational analytics, which examines data on how people interact, to identify “high potentials,” who has good ideas, who is influential, what teams will get work done on time, and more.Companies can mine their “digital exhaust”—data created by employees every day in their digital transactions, such as e‐mails, chats, “likes,” “follows,”  @mentions, and file collaboration—for insights into their workforce. Drawing from our prior research and consulting work with companies, as well as from a large body of other scholars research, we identify six structural signatures that should form the bedrock of any relational analytics strategy to help companies address challenges they face with issues such as diversity and inclusion, succession planning, team assembly, and post-merger integration.'+

We study the methods and the role of affect analysis in the context of text analysis leveraging computational linguistics And psycholinguistic theories. In this talk, we first introduce this space and present a set of studies ranging from affect- sensitive word representations, frustration prediction to finally affective text generation. The talk concludes with an element of explanation and interpretation in the context of subjective affect understanding tasks. '+

It stands to reason that conversational agents should also be supported by background knowledge to effectively converse with humans in specific domains. Such background knowledge can be derived from various resources already available on the web. However, existing dialog datasets contain only a sequence of utterances and responses without any explicit background knowledge associated with them.This has resulted in the development of models which treat conversation as a sequence-to-sequence generation task i.e, given a sequence of utterances generate the response sequence). This is not only an overly simplistic view of conversation but it is also emphatically different from the way humans converse by heavily relying on theirbackground knowledge about the topic (as opposed to simply relying on the previous sequence of utterances). For example, it is common for humans to (involuntarily) produce utterances which are copied or suitably modified from background articles they have read about the topic. To facilitate the development of such natural conversation models which mimic the human process of conversing, we create a new dataset containing movie chats wherein each response is explicitly generated by copying and/or modifying sentences from unstructured background knowledge such as plots, comments and reviews about the movie freely available on the web. We establishbaseline results on this dataset (90K utterances from 9K conversations) using three different models: (i) pure generation based models which ignore the background knowledge (ii) generation based models which learn to copy information from the background knowledge when required and (iii) span prediction based models which predict the appropriate response span in the background knowledge. </p><p align="justify"><strong>Bio:</strong> Mitesh M.
