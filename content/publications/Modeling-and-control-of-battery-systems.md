In this part of the paper, a control strategy for optimal charging is discussed. This work seeks to develop a capacity fade minimizing model predictive control (MPC) framework, which can help in identification and realization of optimum charge-discharge cycles in Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Although the model developed in the first part is a good representation for a battery, it has limitations for on-line applications due to its complexity. For on-line applications, it is important that the model is computationally fast, but at the same time incorporate the effects of various capacity fade mechanisms. Development of a simple lumped model to meet these requirements is also a part of this work.
