authors: ["Arun Tangirala"]
categories: "nptel-courses"
tags: ["fourier transform", "time frequency analysis", "wavelet transforms"]
description: The course introduces the basic concepts of time-frequency analysis such as joint energy density, duration-bandwidth principle, analytic signals, etc. and wavelet transforms, specifically, the continuous and discrete versions. A short review of Fourier transforms will be presented at the start of the course.
