The demand for electrical energy is increasing twice as fast as it is being used. This necessities the need for generating electricity from many sources, transmitting and distributing with augmented efficiency and conserving through optimal usage. With the advent of Smart Grid technologies, meeting the energy demands of the future seems very much possible. Even though the reach of Smart Grid technologies is limited at present, a large amount of data, pertaining to variables like voltage, current, power, etc. on an hourly or half hourly basis, is being generated from the smart meters. The data can be analyzed to improve and expanding Smart grid technologies for Indian markets.
