The main objective of this project is to develop automated strategies for effective control and optimization of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) and water treatment facilities. It is proposed to achieve this objective by suitable instrumentation of the water treatment plants and the distribution networks, online acquisition and transmission of the information to a network management system, and developing control methods that can deal with large scale complex urban water distribution networks.
